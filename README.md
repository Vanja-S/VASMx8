# VASMx8
Compiler for VASMx8 assembly language and file support


## Concept
The VASMx8 is an assembly language created for an 8-bit Von Neumann computer architecture, described in the "Research Papers" directory in "INSERT NAME OF FILE" pdf, although only available in the Slovenian language (the abstract is written in dual format; Slovenian and English).

### Compiler
The project mainly consists of a program written in the C programming language, which is going to represent the Compiler from the .vasmx8 file format, that is full of pure VASMx8 code, into a binary file, capable of being uploaded onto an EEPROM and ran on the computer.
